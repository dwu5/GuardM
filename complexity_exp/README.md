# How to Prove Your Model Belongs to You: A Blind-Watermark based Framework to Protect Intellectual Property of DNN

This is a toy example (on MNIST & CIFAR-10) of how to run our framework presented in [https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01743](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01743)

# Quickstart
* Configure the environment
```
Python=3.7
Pytorch=1.2.0
Others are the latest version
```

# Dataset
* Change `args.dataset='mnist or cifar10'` to define the dataset. And the dataset will be auto-downloaded into `/data`.
* If `args.dataset='mnist'`,  the exclusive logo is a sample picked from the `mnist`dataset randomly.
* If `args.dataset='cifar10'`, the exclusive logo is in the `/data/IEEE/logo`. you can also choose other logos.

# Host Model
* If `args.dataset='mnist'`, you can only implement the framework to embed the watermark into `lenet1, lenet3, lenet5`.
* If `args.dataset='cifar10'`, you can implement the framework to emded the watermark into `vgg11, vgg13, vgg16, vgg19, resnet18, resnet34, resnet101, preactresnet18, preactresnet34, googlenet, dpn26, mobilenetv2`.

# Results

# Notes
* Random initialization and stochastic gradient descent can cause the objective function to find a new local minimum, which means that the result is different each time. Try to change `args.seed` to start another initialization for optimal results.
* Hyperparameter optimization is needed for optimal results (and other tweaks like using high capacity networks).
